# Chinese Rules of Go: A Cosmic Perspective

1. **Heaven and Earth**
The board manifests Heaven, its gridlines crystallize Earth. As humanity resides between Heaven and Earth, stones are planted upon their intersections.

2. **Breath of Life**
All existence relies on Heaven-Earth's vital breath (*qi*). Stones thrive through liberties, perish when breathless.

3. **Equality in Alternation**
The cosmos holds no inherent hierarchy. Thus players alternate turns, embodying cosmic equilibrium.

4. **Cycle of Renewal**
*"The flower that blooms must fall"* (Laozi). When old and new stones expire as one, the nascent claim life while the aged return to dust.

5. **River of Time**
*"All flows as this ceaseless stream"* (Confucius). Global repetition is forbidden, for celestial patterns never mirror themselves.

6. **Purpose Through Struggle**
Meaning arises in survival's crucible. Players carve domains to claim victory. Yet the enlightened transcend earthly gains - some wanderers trace truth in the stones' celestial ballet, unbound by mortal scores.

7. **Practical Resolution**
Final scoring incarnates the *Law of Stone-Bound Truth*:
- **Ancient mandate**: Physically occupy all claimable points.
- **Modern stone-counting**: Any empty intersection you can defend *is* your territory by definition.
- *Huan Qitou* (returning group heads) - The eternal covenant:
  - Each living group pays two eye-points as cosmic tribute - spaces forever beyond possession.
  - These "heads" (life's irreducible cost) are surrendered to the opponent in final reckoning.
- **Flaw of area counting**:
  - How to prove ownership of unplayed voids?
  - **Stone-counting's answer**:
    * Challenge by placing stones. If they live, the land is yours.
    * If all attempts die, the void belongs to none.
  - Victory flows solely from living stones - voids hold no weight in cosmic accounting.
- Thus stone-counting annihilates abstraction, binding all truth to stones that breathe.
